# Hybrid crop yield prediction using Ensemble Extra Tree Regressor

# Abstract:
Crop yield prediction is an important agricultural problem. The Agricultural yield predicts hectogram/hectare(hg/ha) primarily depends on weather conditions (rain, temperature, etc), pesticides and accurate information about history of crop yield is an important thing for making decisions related to agricultural risk management and future predictions. It is a regression problem.  

# Objective of the project:
The main objective of this project is to suggest the Farmers to which crop is best suited for their area based on Temperature, Rainfall and Pestisides used.
Predicted this by using 
1. Ensemble Extratree Regressor.
2. Support Vector Regressor.
3. Decision Tree Regressor.
4. Bagging Decision tree Regressor

but among these 4 models, Ensemble Extratree Regressor model is perform well.

The datasets were collected form the kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset
